A simple custom ImageView that can draw the image in special shapes like circle or hexagon. 

The project runs on Android 2.2+ but might work on older versoin aswell.
To run this on Android version older then 3.0, you need to remove: setLayerType from each renderer

Feel free to use! If you have any improvment, please don't be shy :)
